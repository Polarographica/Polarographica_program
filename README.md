Polarographica_program

Polarographica-Versions 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 have been removed! Polarographica 2.1.0 is an improved version (running under python 3.7). A Bug in Voltammetric modules has been fixed and the GUI has been renewed. 

Polarographica 2.2.2 and its derivatives are running under Python 3.9. In version 2.2.2, the Distribution of relaxation times module was thoroughly re-designed. It contains a new radial basis function, which is based on the analytical DRT of the Cole-Cole-Kernel. Furthermore, it contains additional features such as Kramers-Kronig check.

The Sub-version Polarographica 2.2.2.2 is an improvement of the native Polarographica 2.2.2 version, where the PolArStat modules were thoroughly re-designed. These changes are basically an improvement of the data-acquisition backend, which is now running on a thread and is therefore independent of the main GUI. This removes the flickering of the data acquisition monitor. Note, that the zipped folder of Polarographica 2.2.2.2 does contain the firmware for the PolArStat which can be uploaded to a classical Arduino. The cool feature: when assembled with the shield described in our Publication [5], you have a fully functional potentiostat for about 40 â‚¬, which can run CV and CA. Design files are found in the supplementary information of [5].

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are the prevalently
used techniques in electrochemical investigations. However, quantitative interpretation of experimentally acquired data is usually a non-straight forward task. Polarographica is a graphical user interface program for simulating and evaluating electroanalytical experiments. Polarographica supports simulation and data evaluation of the following electroanalytical techniques at systems involving macroporous electrodes as well as non porous macro- or microelectrodes:

1) Voltamerometric techniques:
Cyclic- and linear-sweep voltammetry (CV/LSV)
Fourier transform alternating current cyclic- and linear-sweep voltammetry (FT-ACCV/ FT-ACLSV)
Cyclic- and linear-sweep staircase voltammetry (STCV/STLSV)
Large sine amplitude cyclic voltammetry (LSA-CV)
Single- and multistep Chronoamperometry (CA)

2) Electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy techniques:
Potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS)
Distribution of relaxation times analysis of EIS data (DRT)

3) Largely automatized classical electrochemical analysis methods like:
Koutecky-Levich analysis
Randles-Sevcik analysis (reversible and irreversible)
Tafel-analysis
Cottrell-analysis

The user is free in choosing electrochemical reaction sequences like CE, EC, CEC mechanisms, diffusion domains (semi-infinite, or finite transmissive/reflective) and electrode geometries (planar, cylindrical, hollow-cylindrical, spherical, hollow-spherical). Furthermore, parasitic reaction can also be considered during data simulation and/or evaluation.


Features of Polarographica

Voltamperimetric techniques:
All voltamperimetric simulations of Polarographica are based on Laplace transformation techniques. The inverse Laplace transformation step for obtaining the time dependent surface concentrations of the electrochemically active 
species is performed numerically, by using the modified Tabbot contour suggested by [1] and its python implementation [2]

EIS
The mathematics of the EIS simulation/evaluation tool are taken from [3].
The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis function (DRT-Tools-NNLS-DRT) of EIS data is basically a translation of the DRT-tools software [4] into Python code. However, it utilizes the NNLS algorithm instead of the quadprog algorithm for the final data fitting step. From version >=2.2.2, an additional DRT function was included, which uses the Cole-Cole function as radial basis function and which is indenpendent from DRT-tools. Furthermore, the entire DRT-module was re-designed.
